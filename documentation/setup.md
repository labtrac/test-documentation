## Inputting Your Data

---

### Things to Consider Before Getting Started

Now Labtrac is set up, you will need to enter all required data (Dentists, Products, Materials etc)

- - - 

<a class="offset" name="pricelists"></a>
### Price Lists

Before you set up your **Dentists**, **Products** and **Materials** make sure you have a clear understanding of all the pricelists that will be in use.

>**Remember**
>
>The **Pricelist** is NOT the [Standard](#standard) of work *(eg. NHS, Independent, Private)*

<a class="offset" name="dentistcodes"></a>
### Dentist Codes

Every dentist in Labtrac needs a unique code. If you already have a coding system in place then you can carry on with that. If not we recommend using the first 4 letters of the surname followed by 01 (in case of duplicates then 02, 03, 04 etc).

Labtrac allows a dentist code of up to 8 characters.

EG.

* WRIG01 - Owen Wright
* WRIG02 - Michael Wright

- - - 

<a class="offset" name="productcodes"></a>
### Product Codes
	
When setting up product codes in Labtrac there are a few things to bear in mind;

* There must be a product code for every standard of work that you do. Meaning if you do NHS, Independent and Private work then you will need 3 codes for each product. In the example below the code (PBC - for Porcelain Bonded Crown) is suffixed with either a **N**, **I** or **P** depending on the standard.

	* **PBC-N** for (NHS) Porcelain Bonded Crown
	* **PBC-I** for (Independent) Porcelain Bonded Crown
	* **PBC-P** for (Private) Porcelain Bonded Crown

<a class="offset" name="deliverymethods"></a>
### Delivery Methods


* To set up how the dentists recieve the work open **Delivery Details** from the content bar on the left side of the screen.

* This opens a list of all your Delivery Methods to add a new one click **Add** in the bottom left.

* Select the **Run** number, which will identify this particular method of delivery.

* Select the **Days**. This is the amount of time you want to allow for the job to arrive in surgery after leaving the Lab.

* Enter the details in the **Delivery Method** section (eg Postal, Courier, Hand Delivered etc)

* The **Rep** and **Sales Area** boxes are optional additional infomation, it is not needed to set up a Run.

- - - 

Once you have entered a code and name click **'Add'**

This will open the dentist details page.

First select whether the dentist is the principal or an associate. If the dentist is selected as the principal this means they receive all their own invoices and handle their own account. If they are selected as an associate you can select whether to invoice the principal or associate. 

Enter an address. The first address being the practice address then the invoicing address. If these are the same, you can use the copy address button once you have entered the practice address.

(If the dentist is selected as an associate you can use the **copy address** button next to the principal’s name to copy their address into all address fields).

Once the address is entered you can then choose from the invoicing options. 

The first check box is **Invoiced** if the dentist is selected as the principal this will be greyed out as a principal must be the one to receive their invoice. If the dentist is selected as an associate, then the invoiced box is optional.

>**Remember**
>
> If invoiced is selected - The associate receives and handles their own invoice. This means they pay their own account.
If invoiced is NOT selected - The principal handles the associates invoices. The principal handles and pays the associate’s invoices.

The next thing to look at is <a href="setup#pricelists">Price Lists</a> and <a href="setup#volumediscount">Volume Discount</a> make sure the dentist is selected on the correct list or discount.
