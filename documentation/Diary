#Diary

- - -

The **Diary** in Labtrac is way for you to add Staff holidays, Lab closures and Bank holidays. When entering a job in Labtrac it will then take the dates you are closed into account.

To add information to the **Diary** follow these steps;

* Open **Diary** from the contents bar

* Select the date that you wish to enter a closure or holiday and click **Add**

* Enter a **Subject**, (**Type** and **Resource** *if required*)

* Enter the **Start Time** and **End Time**

* Add a **Description** *if required*

* Click **OK**

This will then add the dates into the **Diary** and Labtrac will give you a warning if you attempt to book a job out during those dates.
